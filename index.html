                        The mission of this assignment was to generate fake cat photos. The project was done with tensorflow in python. The method that was used to generate the photos was a convolutional Neural Network. The network can be used to accept many kinds of similar images and then generate new versions of the same thing that could possibly fool a human.

                        In this AI assignment I used logistic regression to train a model that can determine if a review is positive or negative. With enough information it becomes very accurate. The algorithm is transparent as well. That is, there are many useful pieces of information that can easily be pulled out of it. For example, we can view how possitive or negative a specific word is according to the system.

                        If you point a camera at a person trying to sit still, the camera can pick up on small motions like the person's breathing and pulse. In this project, my RUE team and I set out to capture such motion and amplify it so that a person can view what would otherwise be hidden from them. When we are finished, we will be able to capture and amplify motion in higher dimesions.

                        In this assignment I used GLSL and JavaScript to add raytracing to a scene. The ray tracer works in real time and everything can be viewed in a browser. It allows for different effects to be visible such as the reflections of light in mirrors, the shininess of the objects, and the shadows that are cast when a light ray is blocked. In order to build up the ray tracer, I was required to complete a number of tasks like add Blinn-Phong lighting, find the closest surface to the camera that a ray hit, and also calculate for the distortions of objects that were stretched or rotated. To the left is an image of the scene that that was the result.

                        For this, I needed to implement a list of mesh processing methods in order to view details about various half edge meshes. The methods were programmed using JavaScript; and finished project allows a user to do things like highlight the edges that are related to a face or a point, or find the area and normal of a face. Along with this, one can also inflate and deflate a mesh or smooth and sharpen the mesh as much as they want to. The image to the left shows off the normal of the points of the mesh (the purple lines), the edges related to the one of the points (the blue lines), and the edges to the mesh that are related to a null face (the green line).

                        This is an ongoing project from my computer graphics course. On the Ursinus College campus there is an old smokestack that was recently repainted by a muralist. The idea of the project is to take some images and videos of the tower and turn them into a 3D model that the artist can annotate. Then the finished product will be put online for other people to view. To the left is an image of part of one of the models that I made for the project using a mix of drone images that were given to me and some of my own.

                        This was a project from when I studied human computer interactions. I and my other group members worked used python to make an interactive app that takes speech as input. The program allows users to log in using a username and password or use neither and continue as a guest. After that, users can interact with the computer in a number of ways and have the program do things like open google chrome to make a google search. When finished, a person can say “goodbye” and the program will close itself.
