                        In this assignment I used GLSL and javascript to add raytracing to a scene. The raytracer works in 
                        real time and everythig can be viewed in a browser. It allows for different effects to be visible 
                        such as the reflections of objects in a flat, curved, or stretched mirror.

                        For this I was tasked with building different scenes by manualy transforming objects and other scenes to
                        get desired results.

                        This is from when I studied human computer interactions. The program takes the user's voice as the only 
                        form of input. It starts by allowing a person to log in with a username and password, or by  having 
                        the user make an acount. They can then make searches for information and when the system gives them a 
                        response it will also save their search history.

                        Recently a muralist repainted an old smoke stack at Ursinus College. The goal of this ongoing project is to 
                        create an online virtual representation of their work for other people to view.
