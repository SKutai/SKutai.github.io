                    Hi! I’m Seraiah Kutai, a programmer from Pennsylvania looking for new software development
                    opportunities. I graduated from Ursinus College in 2022 with a computer science degree and a math
                    minor. <br> <br>

                    While at Ursinus, I took on various roles and activities that helped me to grow as a programmer,
                    leader, and collaborator. As the president of the ACM club, I planned, promoted, and ran events like
                    hackathons. There, I helped other students get started on their creative ideas while also building
                    up the CS community at the college. At the same time, I enjoyed the opportunity to be a student
                    worker at the IT desk. Other than restarting computers and fixing printers, I was responsible for
                    engaging with Dell tech support to get services for the school laptops. I would also replace some
                    laptop parts and train new tech support students to do the same. Beyond helping others deal with
                    their hardware, I got to help students fix their software while I was a CS tutor. I guided
                    first-year students and seniors to understand programming fundamentals, beat deadlines, and
                    persevere with their major. <br> <br>

                    After college, I joined SV Sports as a full-stack software developer. I learned to work with
                    frameworks like Angular and .NET and improved my skills with tools and applications like Azure Data
                    Studio, Postman, VS Code, and GitHub. I mainly worked on the internal portal, which would cause me
                    to regularly meet with other team members to get user requirements for my projects. After that, I
                    would build and test new portal sections, making changes as reviews demanded. Meanwhile, I would
                    also serve as general IT, fixing printers and solving general application issues. Other than regular
                    tech work, I’d also join in seasonal inventory counts and volunteer to be part of events like the
                    MLK Basketball showcase at Souderton High School. <br> <br>

                    Beyond work and school, I continue to program independently for fun. I am currently working on
                    learning the Rust programming language via the book, and am always open to learning something new in
                    the math and CS world. That all being said, I have my limits on how long I can stay out of the sun.
                    I love sports and being in nature, and like with programming, I’m happy to try out just about
                    anything. From personal challenges like bouldering and disc golf to conventional sports like soccer
                    and basketball, staying active is hardly ever a struggle. I also enjoy traveling and taking
                    advantage of opportunities to serve others however possible. As a result, I like going on mission
                    trips with my church and will mention stocking a food pantry as a highlight of a trip to CA. <br> <br>

                    If the weather is forbidding, I’m happy to stay home and watch a YouTube video, play an old game on
                    my PS3, or try out a new board game with friends. I’m always happy to chat about the design of games
                    and systems, whether certain decisions were good or bad, and the logical implications of trying out
                    new rules and methods. Also, having tried many programming languages, I’ve developed opinions on
                    some of them and am always happy to trade ideas with new and old programmers. <br> <br>

                    Anyway, there is plenty more that I could say, but for now, I’d like to invite you to check out the
                    rest of my site and contact me whenever you are ready. I look forward to making impactful ideas a
                    reality.
