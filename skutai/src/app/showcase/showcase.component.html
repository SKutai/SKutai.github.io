                        While working as a full-stack software developer at SV Sports, I helped build the internal
                        portal. Other employees used the portal to manage the company's inventory, make requests to the
                        production team, and view relevant data about company activities. Some of the components of the
                        internal portal that I worked on helped create item data, purchase orders, and audit invoices. I
                        mainly worked with Angular and .NET while building the portal.

                        The mission of this assignment was to generate fake cat photos. The project was done with
                        Tensorflow in Python. The method used to produce the photos was a convolutional neural network.
                        The algorithm repeatedly compares pixels of the new image to the model that it has of what a cat
                        should look like. The result is an evolving image that approaches the likeness of a composite of
                        the test set (the images that were input). The goal was to create an image that a human would
                        believe was an image of an actual cat.

                        For this Artificial Intelligence assignment, I used logistic regression to train an AI model to
                        determine whether a product review is positive or negative. With enough information, the model
                        becomes very accurate. Unlike some other AI algorithms, the algorithm is transparent, meaning
                        one can see words that would score higher in positivity or negativity. For example, given the
                        model that I had, I know that that the word “life” is a positive word with a score of 445.

                        If you point a camera at a person trying to sit still, the camera will be able to detect small
                        motions like the person's breathing and pulse. In this project, my research team and I set out
                        to capture and amplify such motion so that a person can view what would otherwise be invisible
                        to them. We also used a depth camera to amplify motion in higher dimensions. You can use the
                        link to the right to view the academic paper that inspired the project.

                        I used GLSL and JavaScript to add raytracing to a scene in this assignment. The ray tracer works
                        within a browser and runs in real time. It allows for different effects to be visible, such as
                        the reflections of light in mirrors, the shininess of objects, and the shadows cast when a light
                        ray is blocked. To build up the ray tracer, I was required to complete several tasks like adding
                        Blinn-Phong lighting, finding the closest surface to the camera that a ray hits, and calculating
                        the distortions of stretched or rotated objects.

                        half-edge meshes. The methods were programmed using JavaScript. Once completed, the project
                        allowed a user to highlight the edges related to a face or a point. It could also tell the area
                        and normal vector of a face. Along with this, one can inflate, deflate, smooth, and sharpen a 3D
                        mesh as much as they want. The image to the left shows off the normal of the points of the mesh
                        (the purple lines), the edges related to one of the points (the blue lines), and the edges to
                        the mesh that are associated with a null face (the green line).

                        A muralist repainted an old smokestack at Ursinus College. She added many glyphs to the surface,
                        representing meaningful things about the school and its community. In this project, I was given
                        some images and videos of the smokestack, as well as took some of my own. Then, I created a 3D
                        model of the smokestack using the images and videos and some photogrammetry software. After
                        that, I made the model available online for the muralist to annotate. You can now view the

                        My other group members and I used Python to make an interactive app that takes speech as input.
                        The program allows users to log in using a username and password or use neither and continue as
                        a guest. After that, users can interact with the program in a number of ways and also have their
                        computer do things like open Google Chrome to search for things online. When finished, a person
                        can say “goodbye,” and the program will close itself.

                        that they had previously written. The app also saves these notes, so they can be viewed at any
