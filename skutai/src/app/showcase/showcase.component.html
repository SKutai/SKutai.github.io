                        While working as a full stack software developer at SV Sports, I helped to buld up the internal
                        portal. Other employees used the portal to manage the company's inventory, make requests to the
                        production team, and view relevant data to company activities. Some of the parts that I worked on
                        helped to create item data, create purchase orders, and audit invoices. The portal was built 
                        with Angular and .NET.

                        The mission of this assignment was to generate fake cat photos. The project was done with
                        tensorflow in python. The method that was used to generate the photos was a convolutional Neural
                        Network. The network can be used to accept many kinds of similar images and then generate new
                        versions of the same thing that could possibly fool a human.

                        In this AI assignment I used logistic regression to train a model that can determine if a review
                        is positive or negative. With enough information it becomes very accurate. The algorithm is
                        transparent as well. That is, there are many useful pieces of information that can easily be
                        pulled out of it. For example, we can view how possitive or negative a specific word is
                        according to the system.

                        If you point a camera at a person trying to sit still, the camera will pick up on small motions
                        like the person's breathing and pulse. In this project, my RUE team and I set out to capture
                        such motion and amplify it so that a person can view what would otherwise be hidden from them.
                        We also used a depth camera to amplify motion in higher dimesions. Use

                        In this assignment I used GLSL and JavaScript to add raytracing to a scene. The ray tracer works
                        in real time and everything can be viewed in a browser. It allows for different effects to be
                        visible such as the reflections of light in mirrors, the shininess of objects, and the
                        shadows that are cast when a light ray is blocked. In order to build up the ray tracer, I was
                        required to complete a number of tasks like add Blinn-Phong lighting, find the closest surface
                        to the camera that a ray hit, and also calculate for the distortions of objects that were
                        stretched or rotated.

                        For this, I needed to implement a list of mesh processing methods in order to view details about
                        various half edge meshes. The methods were programmed using JavaScript. The finished project
                        allows a user to do things like highlight the edges that are related to a face or a point, or
                        find the area and normal of a face. Along with this, one can also inflate and deflate a mesh or
                        smooth and sharpen the mesh as much as they want to. The image to the left shows off the normal
                        of the points of the mesh (the purple lines), the edges related to the one of the points (the
                        blue lines), and the edges to the mesh that are related to a null face (the green line).

                        On the Ursinus College campus there is an old smokestack that was repainted by a muralist
                        who added a number of meaningful glyps to the surface. The idea of this project was to
                        take some images and videos of the tower and turn them into a 3D model. Then make the model
                        available online for the muralist to annotate. After that, the annotated model was made available
                        for everyone to view. Check out the link to the right to see the final product.

                        users to log in using a username and password, or use neither and continue as a guest. After
                        that, users can interact with the program in a number of ways and also have their computer do things
                        like open google chrome to search for things online. When finished, a person can say “goodbye” and
                        the program will close itself.

                        visits that location, they will get a notification that has the note that they wrote. The app
                        also saves the notes that people have made so that they can view them at any time.
