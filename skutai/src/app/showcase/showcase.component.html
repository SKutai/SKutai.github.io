                        While working as a full-stack software developer at SV Sports, I helped build the internal
                        portal. Other employees used the portal to manage the company's inventory, make requests to the
                        production team, and view relevant data about company activities. Some of the parts I worked on
                        helped create item data, purchase orders, and audit invoices. I mainly worked with Angular and
                        .NET while building the portal.

                        The mission of this assignment was to generate fake cat photos. The project was done with
                        Tensorflow in Python. The method used to produce the photos was a convolutional Neural Network.
                        The network can accept many similar images and then create new versions of the same thing that
                        could fool a human.

                        For this AI assignment, I used logistic regression to train a model that can determine whether a
                        review is positive or negative. With enough information, the model becomes very accurate. The
                        algorithm is transparent as well. That is, many useful pieces of information can easily be
                        pulled out of it. For example, we can view how positive or negative a specific word is according
                        to the system.

                        If you point a camera at a person trying to sit still, the camera will pick up on small motions
                        like the person's breathing and pulse. In this project, my RUE team and I set out to capture and
                        amplify such motion so that a person can view what would otherwise be invisible to them. We also
                        used a depth camera to amplify motion in higher dimensions. Use the link to the right to see the
                        paper that inspired the project.

                        I used GLSL and JavaScript to add raytracing to a scene in this assignment. The ray tracer works
                        within a browser and runs in real time. It allows for different effects to be visible, such as
                        the reflections of light in mirrors, the shininess of objects, and the shadows cast when a light
                        ray is blocked. To build up the ray tracer, I was required to complete several tasks like adding
                        Blinn-Phong lighting, finding the closest surface to the camera that a ray hit, and calculating
                        the distortions of stretched or rotated objects.

                        For this, I needed to implement a list of mesh processing methods to view details about various
                        half-edge meshes. The methods were programmed using JavaScript. The finished project allows a
                        user to highlight the edges related to a face or a point. It could also tell the area and normal
                        of a face. Along with this, one can inflate, deflate, smooth, and sharpen a 3D mesh as much as
                        they want. The image to the left shows off the normal of the points of the mesh (the purple
                        lines), the edges related to one of the points (the blue lines), and the edges to the mesh that
                        are associated with a null face (the green line).

                        Using JavaScript, I was tasked with creating different scenes by transforming different objects

                        A muralist repainted an old smokestack at Ursinus College. She added many glyphs to the surface,
                        representing meaningful things about the school and its community. In this project, I was given
                        and also took some images and videos of the smokestack. Then, I created a 3D model of the
                        smokestack using the media and some photogrammetry software. After that, I made the model
                        available online for the muralist to annotate. You can now view the project's final product

                        log in using a username and password or use neither and continue as a guest. After that, users
                        can interact with the program in a number of ways and also have their computer do things like
                        open Google Chrome to search for things online. When finished, a person can say “goodbye,” and
                        the program will close itself.
